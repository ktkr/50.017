Comments:
Material class was re-written. The implementation of the assignment 4 material was not the same as the one in assignment 5.
Also, it should be explicitly mentioned that we are supposed to multiply by the specular color for reflected and refracted rays.
A relatively quicker assignment compared to assignment 3 and 4. Can be more explicit about certain instructions or else tell people that the formula is in the slides etc.
